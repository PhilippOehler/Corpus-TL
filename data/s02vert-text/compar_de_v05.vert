<!--div class="highlight-para"> <p> Unter <em>Schadprogramm</em> bzw. <em>Schadsoftware</em> (engl. ‚Malware‘, ein Kofferwort aus <i><b>Mal</b>icious</i> ‚bösartig‘ und <i>Soft<b>ware</b></i>) bezeichnet man Software, die entwickelt wurde, um vom Benutzer unerwünschte und gegebenenfalls schädliche Funktionen auszuführen (damit ist nicht Software gemeint, die zufällig Fehler enthält<ins>, obwohl diese auch Schaden anrichten kann</ins>).</p><p>Schadsoftware und unfreie Software sind zwei verschiedene Fragestellungen. Der Unterschied zwischen <a href="/philosophy/free-sw">freier</a> und unfreier Software ist, <a href="/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important">ob die Nutzer das Programm kontrollieren oder umgekehrt</a>. Es ist nicht direkt eine Frage dessen was das Programm <em>macht</em> wenn es ausgeführt wird. In der Praxis ist unfreie Software jedoch oft Schadsoftware, weil die Erkenntnis des Entwicklers, dass die Nutzer machtlos sein würden bösartige Funktionen zu beheben, dazu verführt, einige einzuführen.</p> </div -->
